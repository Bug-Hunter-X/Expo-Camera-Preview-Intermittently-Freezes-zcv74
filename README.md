# Expo Camera Preview Freeze Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API with a custom camera component. The camera preview intermittently freezes, becoming unresponsive. This issue is particularly challenging to debug due to its inconsistent nature.

## Bug Description
The primary problem is that the camera preview freezes unexpectedly.  The camera remains operational in that it continues to capture images, but those images are not reflected in the preview.  The preview remains frozen on the last captured frame. Restarting the app is the only known way to fully resolve this.  We suspect the issue is related to the asynchronous nature of image capture and the re-rendering of the preview component.

## How to Reproduce
Reproducing this bug is challenging due to its intermittent nature.  Frequent image capture seems to increase the likelihood of occurrence.  Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the precise circumstances under which the bug reliably occurs.

## Solution
The provided solution attempts to address the issue by implementing a more robust error handling mechanism and ensuring that the preview component is always updated with the most recent frame. This approach may improve the reliability of the preview but doesn't guarantee a complete solution.  Further research and testing are recommended.
